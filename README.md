# Project RES-Q

Emergencies don’t wait for translation.

RES-Q is a multilingual, voice-driven AI assistant designed to break language and accessibility barriers in emergency response. Built on top of the Gemini Voice Base Stack, it enables natural, real-time conversations between users and rescue systems in any language, using only your voice.

With AI reasoning, speech recognition, and lifelike voice synthesis, RES-Q helps users:

- Ask for help or describe a situation naturally

- Get real-time updates from trusted sources (e.g., weather alerts, nearby hospitals)

- Auto-detect their location via IP geolocation

- Interact hands-free, even in high-stress situations
