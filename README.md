# Project RES-Q

Emergencies don’t wait for translation.

RES-Q is a multilingual, voice-driven AI assistant designed to break language and accessibility barriers in emergency response. Built on top of the Gemini Voice Base Stack, it enables natural, real-time conversations between users and rescue systems in any language, using only your voice.
