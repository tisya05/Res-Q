# Optional (recommended) - add for multilingual support (language detection + translation)
# Install only if you want automatic translation of user input/responses.
# NOTE: this project no longer uses `googletrans` for translation — Gemini or
# ElevenLabs STT should be used instead. Remove googletrans to avoid confusion.

# Notes:
# - faster-whisper requires a working FFmpeg on the system (install via brew/apt).
# - On macOS, you may need to install portaudio before installing sounddevice:
#     brew install portaudio
#   then: pip install sounddevice
